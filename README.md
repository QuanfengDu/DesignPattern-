# DesignPattern
AbstractFactory 
---------------
Provide an interface for creating families of related of dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
There are two types of product, one is CPU, the other one is MMU, each type product can fit into two type platforms, Ember and Enginola. 
The factory interface can return the correct object of product to client without touching the concrete class. 
BuilderPattern 
--------------
The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
